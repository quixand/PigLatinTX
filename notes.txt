<!-- ======================== -->

The general consensus is that there is no official definition of the language and there
are a few variations in translation.


The class should provide the following funtionality:

- convert English -> pig latin
- there should be a strict language option to only convert recognised English words from the dictionary if desired
- provide options to convert prefix
	+ vanilla e.g. following -> ollowingfay
	+ hyphenated e.g. following -> ollowing-fay
	+ a random mixture of the above
- provide options to handle starting syllables:
	+ add -way
	+ add -ay
	+ move syllable and add -hay
	+ a random mixture of the above

- preserve punctuation
- preserve capitalisation

-----------------------------
Rules of translation:

Some strings cannot/should not be translated. for example a phone number or numberic date
